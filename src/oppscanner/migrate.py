"""Migration runner for oppscanner's packaged SQL migrations.

Migrations live under `oppscanner/migrations/*.sql` so they ship inside
the installed package and are reachable via `importlib.resources` -- both
from this repo's own `scripts/migrate.py` and from a downstream package
(e.g. the full/paid overlay) that installs `oppscanner` as a dependency
and wants to run the same migrations without duplicating the SQL. Mirrors
`bidscraper.migrate` (Tool 1) / `leadscorer.migrate` (Tool 2) exactly.
