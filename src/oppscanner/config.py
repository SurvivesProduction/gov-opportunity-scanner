"""Generic environment-based configuration loading for oppscanner.

Loads variables from a `.env` file (if present) via python-dotenv, then
reads them from the process environment. Deliberately identical in shape
to `bidscraper.config` (Tool 1) and `leadscorer.config` (Tool 2) -- this
package knows nothing about any specific client or hosting provider
(e.g. Supabase); that kind of wiring belongs in a downstream "full"
deployment package.

# NOTE: load_dotenv() with no path argument walks UP from THIS file's own
# directory (this installed package's location), not from the caller's
# directory or the process cwd. That means this call only ever finds a
# .env sitting in oppscanner's own source tree -- it does NOT find a
# downstream "full" deployment repo's .env, even though that's almost
# always where the real .env actually lives. Each entry point that needs
# real credentials (scripts/run_client.py, scripts/migrate.py in the
# "full" repo) must call load_dotenv() again, itself, from a file that
# actually lives inside that repo. Same bug class found and fixed in
# bidscraper's (Tool 1) and leadscorer's (Tool 2) own config.py/migrate.py
# -- don't remove a downstream load_dotenv() call that looks "redundant"
# with this one; it's not.
